# apogee2_work_activity
These are materials related to a work session at Mach 30's Apogee 2 event that will compare LiveCode
to Python-Kivy

For the activity, there will be both LiveCode and Python-Kivy teams who will be developing rough
prototype apps per requirements provided by a stakeholder team. The apps will be developed on the
fly, and the intention is for us to gain experience in each of the "competing" platforms. We'll
gain much needed hands-on experience with a real need that Mach 30 has - rocket test stand software.
